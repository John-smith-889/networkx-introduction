## Social Network Analysis in Python - Introduction to NetworkX

NetworkX is a Python library for working with graphs and perform analysis on them. It has built-in many fancy features like algorithms for creating specific graphs genres, or some centrality measures. But in this article we concentrate on work at grassroots - how to create graph, add and remove nodes and edges, add weighted edges, inspect graph properties an visualize graphs.

“By definition, a Graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) along with identified pairs of nodes (called edges, links, etc). In NetworkX, nodes can be any hashable object e.g., a text string, an image, an XML object, another Graph, a customized node object, etc.” — NetworkX documentation

Content below is based on very good NetworkX documentation where you can go deeper into NetworkX. In this post you may see simple examples how to use code.

#### Contents: 
1. Create a graph 
2. Add nodes, edges, weighted edges to a graph
3. Add attributes to graphs, nodes, edges 
4. Check a graph properties 
5. Access edges and neighbors 
6. Draw graphs 
7. Graphs I/O in GML format
